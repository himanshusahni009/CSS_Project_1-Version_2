			<h2>Table Tennis</h2>

					<p>
						Table tennis, also known as ping-pong and whiff-whaff,
						is a sport in which two or four players hit a
						lightweight ball, also known as the ping-pong ball, back
						and forth across a table using small rackets. Table
						tennis is governed by the worldwide organization
						International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF), founded in
						1926.
						<br />
						<br />
						The game takes place on a hard table divided by a net.
						Except for the initial serve, the rules are generally as
						follows: players must allow a ball played toward them to
						bounce one time on their side of the table and must
						return it so that it bounces on the opposite side at
						least once.
						<br />
						<br />
						The game is popular all over the world. In most
						countries it is very highly organized as a competitive
						sport, especially in Europe and Asia, particularly in
						China and Japan.
						<br />
						<br />
						Table tennis improves reflex, eye-hand coordination,
						mental alertness and speed of movement. It also improves
						balance and lowers the chances of falls and injuries.
						Additionally, table tennis is a safe sport to play
						because it is not a contact sport. It is easy on the
						body and can be enjoyed by players of all ages.
