			<h2>Football</h2>

					<p>
						Football is a word which could mean one of several
						sports. The best-known type of football is association
						football. This is called "soccer" in North America,
						South Africa, and Australia to avoid confusion with
						other types of football that are commonly played there.
						<br />
						<br />
						The name football comes from the two words 'foot' and
						'ball'. It is named football because the players of the
						game walk and often run (on their feet) while playing,
						as opposed to (for example) polo where the players ride
						horses. Football is played using a ball, also called a
						'football', that is usually shaped like a sphere or an
						ellipsoid. The ball is often kicked with the foot, but
						depending on the game, it can also be hit using other
						parts of the body (in association football) and handling
						the ball is a part of some other sports known as
						'football'.
						<br />
						<br />
						Some elements of football have been seen in many
						countries, dating back to the second and third century
						AD in China. The modern games of both rugby football and
						association football comes from 19th-century England.
						Kicking a ball goes back to the Middle Ages. Association
						football spread to many other parts of Europe, and was
						brought to the rest of the world with colonization.
						Today, it is the most popular sport in the world and
						many people watch it on television, especially the FIFA
						World Cup that happens every four years.
						<br />
						<br />
						Every year there is a Football Club Competition called
						as Champions League. All the qualified big teams take
						part. At the end, we have one winner who takes the
						prestigious UEFA trophy. All big players play for their
						own teams. Some big players who take part every year are
						Mbappe, Ronaldo, Messi, Dybala, Neymar and many more.
