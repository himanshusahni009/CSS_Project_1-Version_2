			<h2>Cricket</h2>
			<div>
				<div>
					<p>
						Cricket is a sport which is played between two teams of
						eleven players each. One team, which is batting, tries
						to score runs, while the other team is fielding, and
						tries to prevent this. Runs are scored by hitting the
						ball, which is thrown by a player from the fielding team
						to a player from the batting team, across the boundary,
						or by the batting team's players running between two
						areas of the field called the batsman's grounds as many
						times as possible before the fielding team successfully
						hits a wicket (set of sticks) in either of the grounds
						with the ball to get them out.
						<br />
						<br />
						The game started in England in the 16th century. The
						earliest definite reference to the sport is in a court
						case of 1598. Today, it is a popular sport in England,
						Australia, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, South
						Africa, New Zealand, the West Indies and several other
						countries such as Afghanistan, Ireland, Kenya, Scotland,
						the Netherlands, and Zimbabwe.
						<br />
						<br />
						The wickets are sets of three small, wooden posts that
						are at each end of a rectangle of short grass called
						'the pitch', which is 22 yards long. The pitch is inside
						a much larger oval of grass called the 'area of play'.
						When a team no longer has enough "not-out" players left
						to score, then the other team gets the chance to try to
						score. In shorter games of cricket, a team may also have
						to stop batting when the ball has been thrown to their
						players a certain number of times. After both teams have
						had enough chances to score, the team with the most runs
						wins.
