			<h2>Vegetables</h2>

					<p>
						Vegetables are parts of plants that are eaten by humans
						as food as part of a meal. This meaning is often used:
						it is applied to plants collectively to mean all edible
						plant matter, including the flowers, fruits, stems,
						leaves, roots, and seeds. The alternative definition of
						the term 'vegetable' may exclude foods derived from some
						plants that are fruits, nuts, and cereal grains, but
						include fruits from others such as tomatoes and
						courgettes and seeds such as pulses.
						<br />
						<br />
						Carrots and potatoes are parts of the root systems of
						the plants, but since they are eaten by humans, they are
						vegetables. They are not in the same category as a
						fruit, nut, herb, spice, or grain. Though tomatoes are
						often thought of as vegetables, but because they have
						seeds, they are, botanically, fruits. Vegetables are an
						important part of people's daily diet. Vegetables and
						fruits are sometimes called produce. Vegetables have
						vitamins A, B, C, D, minerals and carbohydrates.
						<br />
						<br />
						Virtually all of the more important vegetables were
						cultivated among the ancient civilizations of either the
						Old or the New World and have long been noted for their
						nutritional importance. Most fresh vegetables are low in
						calories and have a water content in excess of 70
						percent, with only about 3.5 percent protein and less
						than 1 percent fat. Vegetables are good sources of
						minerals, especially calcium and iron, and vitamins,
						principally A and C. Nearly all vegetables are rich in
						dietary fibre and antioxidants.
						<br />
						<br />
						Vegetables may be washed, sorted, graded, cut, and
						packaged for sale as fresh products. Fresh vegetables
						are subject to quick aging and spoilage, but their
						storage life can be extended by such preservation
						processes as dehydration, canning, freezing, fermenting,
						or pickling.
